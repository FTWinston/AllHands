# All Hands 

*This project is currently under active development. It's not currently playable.*

**All Hands** is a cooperative, real-time multiplayer card game designed for local party play.

It’s a bridge simulator that's also a deck builder, and also a roguelike. The game runs on a central "host" computer (the viewscreen), while players join the game using their smartphones as controllers.

Each player takes on the role of a specific crew member on a starship. You manage a hand of cards specific to your station. Good communication is essential!
